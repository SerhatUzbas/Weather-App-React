# Weather-App-React

Weather App is my third project for React.

The purpose of this project is using third party APİ, fetching data and distribute it in right way to the user. Because of that, I did not effort too much on design and did not make it responsive. I am aware the looking of site is not perfect.

I used current weather APİ to shown 3 cities current weather, and search APİ to get weather what user wants to see in real time.
